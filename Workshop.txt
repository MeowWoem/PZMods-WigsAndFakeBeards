description=[h2]Description[/h2]
description=Tired of seeing your mannequins looking like bald store rejects? This mod brings the fabulous world of wigs and fake beards to Project Zomboid, so even your lifeless plastic mannequins can look ready for the runway — or the ruin.
description=
description=Craft wigs from real hair (yep, even — and especially — zombie hair. Fashion has its price), slap them on mannequins, or even wear them yourself if you're feeling follicly deprived.
description=
description=Because in the end times, it's not just about surviving — it's about surviving in style. And your mannequins deserve that glow-up too.

description=[h2]Features[/h2][list]
description=[*] Collect hair from corpses or when cutting your own. Or look in a hair salon trash can.
description=[*] Craft and dye wigs and fake beards. The crafting recipe uses: hair tufts, a small tanned leather, thread and a needle, and requires Tailoring level 1
description=[*] The color of the crafted wigs is based on the average of the hair colors used.
description=[*] Place the wigs and fake beards on the mannequins
description=[*] Wigs use "Nose" slot, fake beards use "Mask" slot. So you can wear hats with wigs (note: see Known Issues section)

description=
description=[h2]Planned Features[/h2][list]
description=[*] Mod support for mods that add new haircuts and beards. But be patient
description=[*] Distribute the wigs on the mannequins

description=[h2]Known issues[/h2][list]
description=[*] To give you more freedom in customization, it is possible to use male models on female characters, and vice versa. However, since the game uses different body models for different genders, some hairstyles may not fit perfectly on the character/mannequin.
description=[*] Similarly, you can wear hats on top of wigs. However, depending on the wig and hat combination, some visual clipping may occur. To avoid this, look for wigs with “hat” in their name — they’re designed to fit perfectly without any fuss.

description=[h2]Mods Compatibility[/h2]

description=[h2]Disclaimer about B41[/h2]
